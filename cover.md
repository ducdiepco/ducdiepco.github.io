  Dear Sir/Madam Thank you for your interest in hiring me. Please find my Resume even though it doesnâ€™t list my extensive tea making experience.
</p>

<p>
  Seriously, I would love to help you create a fun yet tasteful software user and application experience for your business. I have almost 5 years experience working with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby and Ruby on Rails/Hanami</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I can help remotely as software architect or developer. I can also do on site backend Ruby, Hanami Web Framework and frontend web development.
</p>

<p>
  I look forward to talking with you about how I may be of help. Please get in touch.

  Thank you!
